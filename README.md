# comp426-twitter
An interactive web application similar to Twitter where users (students of COMP 426 in this case) can create/interact with tweets.
It functioned with a provided RESTful API server designed specifically for the assignment to create an updated news feed style app.
Users can post, update, and delete their own created tweets as well as like/unlike, retweet, and reply to other users' tweets.
The application utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation and Axios to make HTTP requests to the class API.

*Unfortunately the server for the class is no longer available so the application is so longer functional.*
